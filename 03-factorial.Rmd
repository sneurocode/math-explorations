# Factorial

The factorial of a natural number $n$, that is, $n!$ is that number multiplied by all the natural numbers less than that number. Thus, $4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24$. By definition, $0! = 1$.

The Python code below demonstrates how to programmatically determine the factorial of a natural number both non-recursively and using recursion.

``` python
def fact(n):
    list_n = list(range(1, n + 1))
    product = 1
    for number in list_n:
        product *= number

    return product

# Test factorial function: fact
print("Factorial of 5: ", fact(5))  # Ans: 120

def fact_r(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * fact_r(n - 1)

# Test recursive factorial function: fact_r
print("Recursive factorial of 4: ", fact_r(4))  # Ans: 24
```
